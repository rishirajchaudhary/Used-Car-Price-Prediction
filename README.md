# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
This is a used car price prediction project that includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information on used cars listed for sale in the United States. The file provides a brief overview of the dataset, the EDA process, and the conclusion.

# Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- Name: The name of the car
- Location: The location of the car
- Year: The year in which the car was purchased
- Kilometers_Driven: The total number of kilometers driven by the car
- Fuel_Type: The type of fuel used by the car
- Transmission: The type of transmission used by the car
- Owner_Type: The number of owners of the car
- Mileage: The mileage of the car
- Engine: The engine capacity of the car
- Power: The power of the car
- Seats: The number of seats in the car
- Price: The price of the car (the target variable)

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis in this notebook includes the following steps:

- Data Cleaning: Check for and handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert datatypes where necessary.
- Data Visualization: Create visualizations to explore the relationships between the variables and the target variable, and identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Data Preparation: Prepare the data for modeling by encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

# Conclusion
This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the used car price dataset and identifies potential features that could be used to predict car prices. It also outlines the steps necessary to prepare the data for modeling. The next step would be to build a predictive model using the insights gained from this analysis.
